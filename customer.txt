Hello,
on this web there is a map with washing centers in the Czechia
https://www.mapotic.com/samoobsluzne-myci-boxy?zoom=7&lng=16.15076065063477&lat=49.76413578429466
There should be 339 records.
By clicking a place on the map, you get a record detail.
I need to scrape all these places with their detail (detail only what is shown on the picture).
Is it possible to scrape even the pictures and if so, how to link the record and the picture ?
The output of this project should be:
- data file(s) with the records
- reusable script (source + exe)

Thank you,
Petr
